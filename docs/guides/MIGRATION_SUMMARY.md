# FloorMind Migration Summary

## Migration Completed

This project has been migrated from a flat structure to the organized v2.0 structure.

### Changes Made:

1. **Directory Structure:**
   - Created organized src/ directory with core/, api/, scripts/ subdirectories
   - Created models/trained/ for model storage
   - Created outputs/ for generated content and logs

2. **File Migrations:**
   - Model files: google/ → models/trained/
   - Generated outputs: generated_floor_plans/ → outputs/generated/
   - Backup created in: backup_flat_structure/

3. **New Files Created:**
   - src/core/model_manager.py - Centralized model management
   - src/api/app.py - Enhanced Flask application
   - src/api/routes.py - Organized API routes
   - src/scripts/start_complete.py - Complete launcher

### Next Steps:

1. **Test the new structure:**
   ```bash
   python src/scripts/start_complete.py
   ```

2. **Update your workflow:**
   - Use new startup scripts in src/scripts/
   - Place models in models/trained/
   - Generated outputs go to outputs/generated/

3. **Clean up (optional):**
   - Review files in backup_flat_structure/
   - Remove old flat structure files when confident
   - Update any custom scripts to use new paths

### Rollback (if needed):

If you need to rollback:
1. Stop all services
2. Restore files from backup_flat_structure/
3. Remove new src/ and models/ directories
4. Restore original structure

### Documentation:

- See PROJECT_STRUCTURE_V2.md for detailed structure info
- See INTEGRATION_FIX_README.md for integration details
